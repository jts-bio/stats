Binomial Random Variable:
    props:
            - Outcome = Success OR Failure
            - Independent Trials
            - Same prob. for each trial
            - Fixed n trials
            
     example:   Roll 12-sided die 20 times. VAR = Number of 6s rolled
     
     
     
Geometric Random Variable:
    props:
            - Outcome = Success OR Failure
            - Independent Trials
            - Same prob. for each trial
            - Variable n trials
            
     classic form :   How many trials until event X occurs?
